# CSS Basics & The Box Model Demo

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of CSS fundamentals and the CSS Box Model. It includes a styled web page with a navigation bar, personal profile section, product cards, and a blog/article section. Each part uses margins, padding, borders, and background colors to clearly show how the Box Model works. The design is desktop-friendly and uses only HTML and CSS—no JavaScript or external frameworks.

## Files

* **index.html** – Contains the structure and content of the page.
* **styles.css** – Contains all styling rules for the page.

## Features

1. **Navigation Bar**

   * Horizontal menu links with hover effects.
   * Background color, padding, and border applied.

2. **Personal Profile Section**

   * Profile image with rounded border.
   * Name, short description, and styled button.
   * Margins and padding to separate content.

3. **Product Cards**

   * Flexbox layout for alignment.
   * Each card has an image, title, description, and button.
   * Borders, padding, and margins to illustrate the Box Model.

4. **Blog/Article Section**

   * Styled headings and paragraphs.
   * Borders and background color for section definition.

## CSS Concepts Used

* Linking HTML to an external CSS file.

## How to Run

1. Place `index.html` and `styles.css` in the same folder.
